#General
FuriganaTextView is a Textview for Android that supports rendering of furigana characters above Japanese kanji.
The FuriganaTextView builds upon the work of [sh0](https://github.com/sh0/furigana-view) and can be used from XML. However the text has to be set from Java. The library also includes a simple utils class that converts kanji enclosed in <ruby> tags into the string format supported by the widget.
